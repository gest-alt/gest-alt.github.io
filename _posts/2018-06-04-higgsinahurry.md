Explaining particle physics is hard, especially if you're trying to get an explanation between that of a mainstream news article and that of an academic paper.

Alex Bhatt and I worked to fill this gap by pooling together tools to briefly explain the theory and detection methods behind the Higgs Boson discovery in 2012. You can take a look at the project [here](https://npb.space/higgsinahurry/).
